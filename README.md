## **1. Instructions on how to interact with the work:**
Mouse movement: When you move the mouse on the screen, graphic elements will dynamically evade the mouse cursor and bounce back to their original position after disturbance.

## **2. Details of individual methods for adding animation effects to group code:**

### **2.1. Which one did you choose to drive your personal code:**
 Perlin noise

### **2.2. Difference: which attributes of the image will be animated and how to animate them:**
Add handleMouseInteraction() to allow smooth movement of graphical elements through physical simulation.
Add addPerlinEffect() to create organic distortion with Perlin noise. A unique flow field visualization method is used to achieve noise-based pattern deformation, for example: the noise() function is used to generate continuous random values, and the deformation is dynamically changed through the time parameter, maintaining the overall continuity of the shape.
Add class FlowParticle, add particle animation, particles follow the flow field. Add a class Particle to add a random float effect to the particle.
Also add collision detection for graphic elements.

The design is inspired by a variety of elements found in nature. The radiant lines simulate the softness and fluffiness of dandelion pompoms, giving a light and airy visual effect. The disturbed circular pattern refers to the dancing dandelion, as if a gust of wind blows, and the seeds are scattered with the wind, light and free. The overall design also incorporates the wave effect of the water pattern, as if the ripples on the water surface, conveying a dynamic and flowing feeling, highlighting the endless changes of nature and life.

### **2.4.A short technical explanation:**
Flow field system: Use 3D Perlin noise to generate dynamic vector fields. Refer to Daniel Shiffman's tutorial.
First, the three-dimensional space is mapped to the screen space, where x and y correspond to the screen coordinates, and z is represented by time, making the field change with time. Then, the vector field is generated by noise, and the vector direction of each lattice point is determined by the noise value. Specifically, the noise() function generates values between 0 and 1 and maps these values to the angular range (0 to 2π). In order to achieve dynamic updating, the z value (i.e. the time dimension) changes slowly, so that the field changes with time. At the same time, in order to maintain spatial coherence, the noise increment (inc) of x and y is kept fixed. In this way, the vector field can change dynamically in three-dimensional space and maintain a consistent structure. The advantage of this technique is that it generates continuous, smooth flow animations.

### **2.5.Changes：**
First of all, I unified the basis, cut the inconsistent style of the circle, so that the picture unified tone. Then I adjusted the radius and spacing of the circle to fit the canvas better. Then I added the gridSize variable to control the grid size and adjusted the circle again to better fit the grid layout. Now the circles are evenly distributed throughout the canvas.
Then I chose to add the perlin noise effect to the screen, so I added the addPerlinEffect() method to each class to initially uniform the flow contour effect of Perlin noise. I modified the relevant parameters to make the disturbance effect of noise more vivid, for example: modify time in draw()。
I found the current distribution of circles a bit rigid, so I wanted to make the distribution and size of circles more random, so I modified the setup() and draw() functions to add the circles array and the time variable. Add collisions at the same time. Check to make sure the circles do not overlap. Then I modify the range of random positions in the setup() function, adding the minimum distance between circles to expand the distribution. I also added the windowResized() function to the code to make it screen adaptive.
I added a background to the code to enrich the image, and based on this I painted the wave effect and the floating particle effect. To make the wavy background blend more naturally with the current code, I decided to use a translucent effect while adding anti-collision code for them. Floating examples random size and speed of particles, using Perlin noise to control the movement, creating a natural feeling of water wave flow.
Finally, I added the FlowField class to the background, adding flying and dragging particles to enrich the picture. At the same time, adjust the parameters to optimize the screen, such as changing the collision detection parameters to make the screen elements softer. Based on this, I modified the background again, making it a soft gradient to increase the effect of the picture. New methods were also added to handle mouse interaction. The circle dodges when the mouse approaches and slowly returns to its original position when the mouse leaves. The Perlin noise adjustment movement is used in the handleMouseInteraction() method of the CirclePattern class.
